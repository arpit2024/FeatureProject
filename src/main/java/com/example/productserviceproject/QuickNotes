Annotations:-
Spring is working on lot of Annotations-(Annotations for every little task)

Now spring to be able to know that a particular class is a important class
Springs Expects us to annotate that particular class
Ex- If it's a Controller we annotated it with @RestController
it tells that Hey Spring Please go through the code of this particular class, within the code of the class
there are some imp things that you need to take care of.


So Just Think of these Annotation- Service, Controller,Configurations as Markers.All of these Annotations define them as Special Class

for Ex- this part is within Application Configuration Class
 @Bean
    public RestTemplate  createRestTemplate()
    {
        return new RestTemplateBuilder().build();
    }

 so if we put this any controller class, still it would be considered/found, so all of these are just Markers

*) so if anything is present in Spring's Application Contexte we can use it anywhere
->so config package is something which we want to use overall
