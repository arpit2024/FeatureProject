Error:-Need to set ID value Manually

So after writing addProducts method completely the spring run successfully
But once i try to send a POST request from the POSTMAN i got error.

so when i tried to check in the logs, in intellij the error in 1st line was
org.hibernate.id.IdentifierGenerationException: Identifier of entity 'com.example.productserviceproject.models.Product' must be manually assigned before calling 'persist()'

Here behind the scene Save() method is calling Persist() method.
The problem is , if we go wherever we have set ID,Model Package -(BaseModel/Product /category)class we have to set ID manually.

But here i have just declared it as
        private Long id;
i have not told Database from where to generate this ID Automatically(No Strategy).
in this case,DB expect user to provide ID manually or tell DB to generate itself.

so we need to use annotation for DB to create Auto Increment ID
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)


In ProductController Class
-------------------------------
Q)how to dynamically set the category id? becoz one who save product may not know the id of the category?
-then we need some complex logic
do in addNew Product service method we need to write the logic

@PostMapping
    public Product addNewProduct(@RequestBody Product product){
        Category category=product.getCategory();
        if(category.getId() != null){
            Category savedCategory=categoryRepository.save(category);//this will return the category that is saved
            product.setCategory(savedCategory);
        }

        return productService.addNewProduct(product);

Or say Controller will never know/ask the id of the category
Optional<Category> categoryOptional=categoryRepository.findByName(product.getCategory().getName());

        if(categoryOptional.isEmpty()){
            Category savedCategory=categoryRepository.save(product.getCategory());
            product.setCategory(savedCategory);
        }else{
            product.setCategory(categoryOptional.get());
        }

In Category Repository we add another method
Optional<Category> findByName(String name);

Now After editing the below code, we just ask the name from people and do the task
No need to ask any id/thing from the USER
But here we need Minimum 2 DB calls -
    1st to check if category exist or not
    2nd to save the category if not exist
