In MappedSuperclass will there be a Table of parent class
-> No, there will be no table for parent class

So just annotate your parent class with @MappedSuperclass-
-> once i annotate in parent as MappedSuper class, all of the Parent attributes will be available
 in child class Table

Now what should child class be annotated with?(Will For the Child class a table will be created).
-> Yes, a table will be created for child class and annotate your child class with @Entity and you are good to go.

Now once annotated both child class will have tables created
we can run the program now and see the output.


Note: If you want to have a table for parent class as well then annotate your parent class with @Entity and @MappedSuperclass
