Q) Do we have a Table for (User)Parent Class in this Approach?
->Yes

Q) Do we have a Table for (User)Child Class in this Approach?
->No

In single table there will be one table for parent which contains all of the attributes

Here we will be having all of the columns of the parent class as well as columns of the child class within one table

with that we will also be having a type column which will be having the type of the child class.

for each type of user such as mentors/instructor we will be giving value of type integer
for this we are using discriminator column annotation(which has name and type)


Q)What if we have a user which is mentor and instructor ?
Not possible, Disadvantage of this type.


so when we run this in the output
we will be having one table with all of the columns of the parent class as well as child class
i.e
id
name
email
user_type
favorite_student
average_rating

So if we save a user, id will be filled
name will be filled
email will be filled
user_type will be filled as "0"
rest other columns will be null
