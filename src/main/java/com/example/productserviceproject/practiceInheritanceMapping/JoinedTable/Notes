In this Type what all changes needs to be done in Parent Class(User) ?

Q) will there be table of Parent (User)Class in this Approach ?
->Yes

Q) will there be table of Child (Mentor)Class in this Approach ?{
->Yes- Annotate the class with entity

But in Joined Table Approach, the Mentor(child)class will not have any entity from its parent class.
Instead it just going to have the user id- th user which will have all of those attributes
which is the primary key of the parent class.

so for this reason we also use another annotation called
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="user_id") in mentor class(which basically makes the user_id as a primary key and foreign key to the parent table)
In this particular child table we will have a additional column called user_id which is a foreign key to the Parent table


Similarly Attributes of Parent table are not available in Instructor class too,Hence we will have another column
to join parent and child class tables.


Note-
In User Table/class we declared id,name,email.
Ex:- we declared only one variable i.e AverageRating in Mentor class, hence we only get that and an user-id column in Mentor table.
In child class the user_id column is not a primary key, it is a foreign key to the parent table.
but if we need any primary key in child table then we need to remove @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn annotation and explicitly need to define @id in child class/table;
