Only Difference Between Mapped Super class and Table Class is
Mapped Super class is not a Entity Class and Parent will not be mapped to any table in the database.
But in case of Table Class type Parent will be mapped to a table in the database.

How to use Table Per Class ?
In this case User is an Entity Class and it is mapped to a table in the database.
so annotate user class with @Entity and @Table(name="USER_DETAILS")

to decide what kind of Inheritance?
->use @Inheritance(strategy=InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)

So parent class is taken care f, now what about child class?
->Mentor class is a child class of User class.
1)will there be a table of Mentor class in the database?
->yes, so annotate Mentor class with @Entity

2)Do i need to put inheritance strategy for Mentor class?
->No, Inheritance strategy only needs to be used in the parent(User) class.


So the table structure of Both MappedSuperClass and TablePerClass will be like this
the table of child class will have all attributes of child class and attributes of parent class as well.
