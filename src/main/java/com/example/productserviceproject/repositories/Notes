So to implement selfProductService we get question how my service class will be able to implement
the methods-> via database

So to talk to database service class needs a middle layer Called Repository.
So since we are using JPA we will use Interface- Reason is detailed in "Spring Data JPA Notes"
These are also called as 'dao'
DAO-DataAccessObject focuses on abstracting and encapsulating the interaction with a data
storage system (such as a database).
DTO-DataTransferObject focuses on encapsulating and transferring data between different
parts of a software application.

So we will create a repository interface called ProductRepository-Annotate the class with @Repository
-But till now we have not told JPA-Hey JPA in this particular interface i will be having lot
of methods where i will be getting details wrt to Products-such as saving,deleting,fetching

so in interface method signature,
Parameter should be ->Datatype as Product and also mention datatype of Primary key of Product as Long
- public interface ProductRepository extends JpaRepository<Product,Long>(){}
